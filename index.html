                    <h4>AI of the Past</h4>
                    <p>Over 65 years ago, artificial intelligence (AI) was seen as a burgeoning field of study, brimming with endless opportunities. As AI became more resource-efficient and advantageous, it was increasingly integrated into various industries. However, the rapid replacement of traditional jobs led to mass protests and widespread fears, transforming a once-promising field into a source of potential economic instability.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-2">
                    <h4>AI of the Recent</h4>
                    <p>The concept of jobs and careers has been redefined to better align with attributes that AI cannot replicate: innovation and interpersonal relationships. There has been a surge in opportunities for creative output, particularly because AI lacks the capacity for novelty and originality. More careers are now focusing on interpersonal relations and the management of AI as it becomes more integrated into daily functions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-2">
                    <h4>AI of Today</h4>
                    <p>Today, AI has seamlessly become an integral component of nearly every aspect of society, enhancing daily activities and operations. Programs and government interventions have reduced required work hours, increased incomes, and placed greater emphasis on personal achievement and well-being. With a continued drive for creative ingenuity, innovation is rapidly advancing with the help of AI.</p>

                    <p>A new virus, MEME-19, was recently discovered in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This highly contagious virus has resulted in 2,019 documented cases in recent days. The city is currently exercising caution and has issued notices about the viral outbreak to prevent any further spread among its citizens.</p>

                <h4>Energy Development Update</h4>
                <p>In previous years, the world relied heavily on natural gas and oil to fuel its economy and maintain its fossil fuel-reliant infrastructure. However, an international project has recently achieved success in developing nuclear fusion, a breakthrough that could significantly change how energy is produced. The specifics of these results are still being verified to estimate the potential energy output from this method.</p>

                <h4>The Rise of Smartphone Usage and its Competition</h4>
                <p>In the past, several countries established mandates and laws to regulate a fair and competitive market in the smartphone and appliances industry. Concurrently, the smartphone market has surged in several countries, including China and India, driven by increased internet accessibility. As a result, domestic companies in these regions have begun to invest in and develop more software applications for portable devices, particularly social media platforms.</p>

                <h4>Increaing Tension and Data Protection</h4>
                <p>With the rise of foreign companies developing social platforms globally and the significant revenue generated from data, tensions between countries have increased. In particular, a few decades ago, the United States decided to ban TikTok. However, many of its citizens still managed to access the application through various methods of sideloading apps.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p-4">
                <h4>Internet Isolation of the Potential Future</h4>
                <p>To resolve the issue, the United States will be constructing its version of a firewall to isolate foreign influence on Americans and for the protection of national security. Protests are occurring over the restriction of the Internet as an attempt to control the mass public and being a violation of the right to free speech. The plan for the firewall has passed both the House of Representatives and Senate. The bill will be passed on to the United States president in the upcoming months.</p>
